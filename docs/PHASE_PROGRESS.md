# Phase Progress

## Current Phase

Phase 15 - Native Deterministic VFX Foundation

## Current Milestone

15.8 - VFX performance budgets and resource cleanup

## Status

IN_PROGRESS - milestones 15.1 through 15.7 completed and validated; 15.8 is next.

## Completed

- Phases 1-8 completed at their documented MVP scope; remaining limitations
  are assigned to later phases rather than reopening whole phases.
- Historical Phases 9-12 are `NOT_DEFINED / DEFERRED`: only titles survive and
  no implementation criteria may be invented.
- Historical Phase 13 is `DEFERRED`: only a summary survives and explicitly
  says the distinct phase remains incomplete.
- Phase 14 architecture consolidation committed and pushed as `3a8487a`.
- Phase 15.1 typed VFX definitions, pure instances, parameter schema, registry,
  validation, inclusive timing helpers, and schema 9 compatibility adapter.
- All 12 legacy definitions are projected from the authoritative
  `EffectRegistry`; there is no copied preset dataset, project store, or lane.
- Legacy IDs, names, timing, positions, targets, parameters, and enabled state
  round-trip. Unsupported new-only fields fail reverse conversion explicitly.
- Project schema remains 9 and `track_effects_main` remains authoritative.
- Phase 15.2 stable UTF-16 hashing, typed/versioned seed derivation, and
  counter-addressed Mulberry32 sampling with fixed regression vectors.
- Pure `evaluateVfxFrame` validation, explicit inactive states, inclusive local
  timing, deterministic quality scale, resolved parameter defaults, and cloned
  primitive inputs.
- Repeated, stepped, scrubbed, reordered, structured-cloned, JSON-reloaded, and
  real schema 9 save/reopen evaluations match byte-for-byte.
- Phase 15.3 versioned primitive descriptor/output unions and pure dispatcher
  for particle emitter, beam, trail, expanding ring, and light pulse.
- Allocation caps, clamp warnings, finite-output checks, stable per-channel
  seeds, literal particle quality prefixes, and nested beam/trail/ring samples.
- Renderer-neutral placement/points/scalars remain cloneable and cannot alias
  frame or descriptor input data.
- Phase 15.4 pure effects timeline commands for insert/edit/move/trim,
  duplicate, copy/paste, enable, priority, delete, and canonical lane sync.
- Real timeline drag/trim handles and Effects Library/Inspector edits, with one
  HistoryStack checkpoint per successful non-no-op command.
- Save/reload/package/undo/redo preservation for effect timing, order, names,
  enabled state, payloads, canonical labels, and foreign lanes.
- Bounded plain-data validation, 4,096-instance editor growth ceiling with
  oversized legacy repair, and legacy renderer stack/particle budgets.
- Phase 15.5 schema-generated Inspector controls for number, integer, boolean,
  color, and enum parameters, with metadata, defaults, bounds, runtime-support
  disclosure, and honest keyframe deferral.
- Parameter commits use the existing schema 9 timeline controller. Invalid
  legacy values can be repaired without dropping unknown keys, and safe color
  tokens are enforced before renderer consumption.
- Phase 15.6 project schema 10 with deterministic migrations from schemas 1-9,
  one native VFX record per existing effect, synchronized identity/timing/data,
  persisted seed/transform/target/parameters/local keyframes/blend/layer/
  qualities, and explicit future/corruption rejection.
- JSON, `.minemotion`, browser autosave, history, and package render jobs share
  the canonical serializer. Autosave retains a previous payload for recovery;
  lossless schema 9 rollback rejects native-only fields instead of dropping them.
- Phase 15.7 makes schema 10 native frame preparation the shared runtime input
  for Three.js world effects, React overlays, PNG/sequence, WebM, and FFmpeg.
  Local parameter keyframes evaluate deterministically, targets resolve with
  warnings, and `includeVfx=false` short-circuits every VFX layer.
- WebM now records the same composited captured frames as PNG/FFmpeg at the
  selected output resolution; render state restores export settings as well as
  camera/timeline state after completion, error, or cancellation.

## In Progress

- Phase 15 foundation. The next unit is milestone 15.8: measured global budgets,
  renderer resource ownership/disposal, and repeated lifecycle validation.

## Not Started

- Phase 15.8 performance limits and resource cleanup.
- Phase 15.9 full phase validation.
- Later defined roadmap phases 16-25.

## Blockers

- None for Phase 15.8 TypeScript work.
- Manual Phase 15.5 browser smoke is environment-blocked because the in-app
  browser client cannot attach (`Cannot redefine property: process`).
- Host Smart App Control blocks release-profile Cargo build scripts; debug
  desktop bundles passed at `1e911af`.

## Last Validated Commit

- Repository baseline before Phase 15.1: `3a8487a`.
- Phase 15.7 is the validated checkpoint containing this document; Git history
  remains the source of truth for its resulting commit hash.

## Last Validation

- `npm ci`: PASS - 108 packages audited, 0 vulnerabilities
- `npm run typecheck`: PASS
- Focused Phase 15.7 tests: PASS - 6 files, 34 tests
- `npm test`: PASS - 67 files, 307 tests
- `npm run build`: PASS - existing large-chunk warning only
- `npm audit`: PASS - 0 vulnerabilities
- Native checks: not rerun because milestone 15.7 changes TypeScript/docs only.
- Manual visual smoke: BLOCKED_BY_ENVIRONMENT - browser bootstrap repeats
  `Cannot redefine property: process`; automated presentation tests pass.

## Next Exact Action

Measure current per-frame effect/particle/segment/stack work and resource churn.
Add global budgets before allocation, explicit object-tree disposal, and repeat
add/remove/reopen/export/retry/cancel lifecycle tests without changing visuals.
